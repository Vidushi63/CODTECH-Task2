## Objective:
To develop a Java program that enables users to input, track, and manage student grades for various subjects or assignments. The program will calculate the average grade, display the overall grade, and provide additional information such as letter grades or GPA.

## Key Features:

### Grade Input:

Allow users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
Provide a user-friendly interface for entering grades.
Grade Calculation:

Calculate the average grade based on the input grades.
Support different grading scales (e.g., percentage, letter grades).
Grade Display:

Display the overall grade in a clear and concise manner.
Provide additional information such as the corresponding letter grade or GPA.
Additional Features:

Allow users to view individual grades for each subject or assignment.
Support updating or deleting grades as needed.
Provide statistical insights such as highest and lowest grades, and grade distribution.
### Technical Requirements:

### Programming Language:

Java
### User Interface:

Console-based or GUI-based interface for interacting with the program.
### Data Storage:

Use in-memory storage (e.g., arrays or lists) to manage grades.
Optionally, implement file-based storage for persistent grade data.
### Grading Scale:

Support for multiple grading scales (e.g., percentage, letter grades, GPA).
Configurable grading thresholds for letter grades (e.g., A: 90-100, B: 80-89).
Implementation Plan:

### Design Phase:

Define the structure of the program, including classes and methods.
Design the user interface and interactions.
### Development Phase:

Implement the core functionalities such as grade input, calculation, and display.
Develop additional features for updating, deleting, and viewing grades.
Implement grading scale conversion and GPA calculation.
### Testing Phase:

Test the program with various input scenarios to ensure accuracy and robustness.
Validate the correctness of grade calculations and display.
### Deployment Phase:

Package the program for distribution.
Provide user documentation and instructions for running the program.
### Expected Outcomes:

A functional Java program that effectively tracks and manages student grades.
Accurate calculation and display of average grades and additional information.
A user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of grade management.

By completing this project, users will have a reliable tool for managing student grades, which can be beneficial for teachers, students, and academic institutions.
